# Info

# Application Description
Our application Streamlit Metrics helps in visualizing, analyzing, classifying, and clustering data from CSV or XLSX dataset files.

# Application Functionality
First, we upload the file (XLSX or CSV) which contains the dataset using the Browse Files button. Then, in the Raw Data tab, the dataset is displayed in table form, along with a pre-configured chart that is formatted according to the specific dataset (WorldBank) that has been analyzed. We move on to the 2D Visualization tab where features selected by the user are visualized based on the chosen reduction algorithm. In the next tab, which concerns classification algorithms, the user selects the algorithm of interest, the features they wish to analyze, the reduction algorithm for better feature distribution, and any necessary parameters for the classification algorithm. Next, there is a tab for clustering algorithms where the user follows the same functional procedure as in the classification tab, so that clustering is performed according to the dataset labels. Finally, in the last two tabs, the user can read information about the application, the team behind it, and its functionality. If everything is entered correctly, a success message "Done!" is displayed; otherwise, an error message is shown.

# Development Team
The development team consists of two members: Christos Kaldanis, an undergraduate student at the Department of Informatics, Ionian University, who is responsible for implementing the application, and Konstantinos Lygouris, who is also an undergraduate student at the Department of Informatics, Ionian University.

# Tasks
The tasks implemented by each member are:

Christos Kaldanis was responsible for: Raw Data, 2D Visualization, Classification Algorithms, Clustering Algorithms, Docker, GitHub, LaTeX Report.

Konstantinos Lygouris was responsible for: UML Diagrams, Software Release Life Cycle, Writing the Results and Info tabs.
